* About this repository

This is *not* an official repository for SWAT. It exists mostly
because of the lack of official _public_ one.

This repository is an attempt to bring various revisions under one
umbrella to make it easier to track code changes and keep up with
newer revisions. [[http://www.cmake.org/][CMake build system]] is used to make compiler and
platform independent build process. Testing is mostly done with
gfortran compiler on MS Windows and Ubuntu GNU/Linux.

More information can be found in [[https://github.com/mlt/swat/wiki][wiki]].
